# C²
## Introduction
The C² language is a basic programming language I've been designing since around June or July in 2023, with the purpose of creating a higher-level language, inspired by the C language, compatible with the C language, while having higher-level features without C++'s inconsistency, as well as hoping to make it the #1 reason to not use Rust.
